**A Simple Collatz Sequence App**

The Collatz Sequence is a sequence of numbers relevant to the Collatz conjecture. It's theorized that
any number using this algorithm will eventually be reduced to 1. This simple console app will tell you
how many steps it takes. Input any number and the app will list all the numbers and steps to 1.
